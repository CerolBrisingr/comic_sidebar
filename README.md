## Why would I want this?
You're reading something online and it's taking quite a lot of sessions? Maybe new pages come out over time and you need a reminder for when to look?
Maybe you want to wait for a few episodes to be released and come back later where you left things?

Well, you're in luck because that's what this sidebar is for.

## How does it track a page?
Visit your page and then click on "Add reader" in the sidebar.  

Say, you are reading a page 
>https://some.page/chapter/page1

First thing, give this entry a name.  
Next thing, you just drag & drop your mouse and mark the part of the URL that stays the same between pages, in this case you might choose
>https://some.page/chapter/page

Confirm this and you end up with a list entry that will gather the latest 4 unique links with this pattern that you visited. Clicking the entry will lead you to the most recent link.  
This tracking will happen automatically, you don't need to interact with the sidebar any further to keep up to date.  
In case you want to suspend gathering links to a topic, you can disable/enable the entire tracking feature easily.

## You promised a reminder?
As of now, the entry for your page just stays there. You want it out of your mind until it's worth to come back? Well, since you made this entry, you already scrolled over the scheduling feature!  
You have a few options on what to do once you leave a page:
* Always show your entry
* Hide it for a set amount of hours/days/months
* Show it again on set days of the week
* Show it again on set days of the month

Separate from those options you can choose to send the entry on a one-time hiatus. Select a day in the future or a number of days until which your normal reset pattern will be suspended. After this, your normal selection will take over again.  
Maybe you need a break, maybe the author needs one. This way you can make one :)

## Anything on the horizon?
### Improved recognition
Some pages don't have a parser-friendly URL scheme. Tracking the page name looks like a viable path to improve.  
Regular expressions might have a place as well at that point.

### Page aliases
Pages move from time to time, sometimes they even jump between URLs. Adding tracking-URLs and removing others sounds like a good idea.

### Improved tags
You can alredy define tags and search for them. But it would be good to be able to hide specific tags. E.g. set up a "complete" tag and hide those entries.

### Notes
Add some information to a ressource you're reading

### Ratings?
Ok, not so sure about this. This sidebar will stay private so there will never be any form of gathered ranking. But maybe you want one for yourself?
